Project Description Task 1 - build a model to answer a question question: Model the err, and errf columns for individual 'scanners' to show a
expected failure rate of the encoder component. Scanners identified into two groups, based on the following criteria and grouping: never fail: 
scanners whom never reach the 12 % range for err routinely fail: scanners whom reach the 12% range for err on a routine basis err and errf 
are both float values, they are loosely tied to each other, and are not a 1 for 1 relationship, e.g. a rising err value doesn't mean a errf 
value will rise, nor the opposite.
Failure is defined as a err that is above 12 % and/or a errf that is above 0.5 %

background: err and errf represent a encoder error rate at which a led light is pulsating into a window barrier. This barrier, and subsequent calculation, represent the rate of rotation of a component, and the compensated ERRor and ERRor Filtered value.
task 3 - explain why the model was chosen to answer the question asked

task 4 - explain the performance of the model, and of other models that would prove the same question.

task-5: Build documentation and share it across.
